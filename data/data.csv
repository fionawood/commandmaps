In your simulation, after clicking on Zoom for example, the next test begins with the user returned to the starting view (Home). In actual use, the Ribbon is left in View after one clicks Zoom. This is helpful if one is using all the commands in the View menu, but if you are going back to formatting, then to view changes, then to Inserting things you are constantly jumping between ribbons. In a pop-down menu system, you always return to the initial state (just the menu bar). I liked your alternate UI better because I did not have to jump back and forth to ribbon pages.","Ribbon,Commandmap",1796.4333,2223.5667,427.133420,,,Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0,mouse,ribbons,,"Commandmap,Ribbon",3261.6,2707.3333,-554.266721,,,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.65 Safari/537.36",trackpad,commandmaps,whyyyyyyyyyyyy,"Ribbon,Commandmap",1717.8667,2372.7333,654.866622,,,"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.76 Safari/537.36",mouse,commandmaps,love it,"Commandmap,Ribbon",1235.8667,1621.3333,385.466623,,,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.76 Safari/537.36 OPR/16.0.1196.80",trackpad,commandmaps,sup,"Commandmap,Ribbon",1532.1333,1786.3333,254.238,A2QLSHXNCHBRN4,49af,Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0,mouse,commandmaps,,"Commandmap,Ribbon",2311.4,2038.5,-272.939,A2YFPO0N4GIS25,1f33,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.76 Safari/537.36",mouse,ribbons,,"Commandmap,Ribbon",1468.7667,2862.5667,1393.840,A2UX7ZJEGGU5,432b,"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; CrOS armv7l 4319.96.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.74 Safari/537.36",trackpad,ribbons,"I really liked the song, the picture that flashed right before this screen kind of freaked me out.
